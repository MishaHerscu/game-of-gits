House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

All of the Lannisters and Boltons were slain and Ned sat on the iron throne.
However, before long, the silver-haired Daenerys Targaryen arrived from the
east with her three dragons. In the few short years Ned sat on the throne, the
dragons had grown to be extremely enbiggified. They easily defeated the forces
of the seven kingdoms, including Ned, who was summarily executed.

Unfortunately for Daenerys Targaryen, winter was coming...
